    "The Z-score is 1.3 standard deviation above the mean. In a z-test of proportions, we look up the z-score of the α in a one-tailed test. We calculate 100%-5%= 0.95. Looking up the value in the z-score table results in a z-score between 1.64 and 1.65. As our computed z-score of 1.31 is smaller than 1.64, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Meaning, we fail to reject that the old page performs worse or equal compared to the new page. The same is true when we evaluate the p-value. Since it is a one-sided z-test, we subtract our p-val from the total 1-0.0949. We receive 0.9051, which is similar to the p-value from our simulation (0.903). Since, it is greater that 5%, we fail to reject the null. Hence, both, z-test and the simulation to calculate the statistical significance have the same outcome."

In other words, we fail to reject that there is no relationship between the type of page and conversion. Although we achieve the same practical result, the p-value from the regression differs from the simulation and z-test. The reason is the difference of our hypotheses. While we focus on the right tail/new landing page in the simulation and z-test, we consider both possible pages in our logistic regression model.  \n",
    "Since the p-value of our logistic regression is calculated based on both tail ends of our type I error, but our previous hypothesis test considered only the upper side, we cannot compare both p-values directly. We divide 0.19 by 2 (0.095) to make the p-value one sided and subtract it from the right side: 1-0.095=0.905. Now, our p-value is comparable to the p-values from the simulation (0.9038) and z-test (0.9051). As our corrected p-value of 0.905 greater than alpha of 0.05, we fail to reject the null.

    "When we run A/B test, we should generally think about the validity of tests in addition to statistical significance. As decision making is complex, we usually expect to improve the model by adding influencing variables to our regression model.  \n",
    "There are typical A/B test biases that may influence our experiment. People may be more likely to convert because they are curious about the changes (novelty effect) or they may be discouraged by the changes (change aversion). These effects may be evened out by running the experiment long enough, but not too long to get users accustomed to the changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We may also think about other time-related effects on our conversions: e.g. seasons, weekdays/weekends, time of the day, when marketing campaigns are run, societal events. In this sense, analyzing time may improve our regression model. Secondly, we may reduce possible selection bias by tracking user-related data (e.g. account data, acquisition/activation funnels). We want to make sure to get a sample that represents our target population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we may add any sales related effects. Discounts and special offers, marketing campaigns, email marketing etc. may drive conversions. Generally speaking, it makes sense to gain a good understanding of the baseline of our website usage to understand whether our landing page really performs better.    \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we should also be aware about the danger of overfitting our regression model. Adding too many factors may result in invalid outcomes. By considering too many specific variables of our sampling group, we may end up fitting the model well to the characteristics of our sample, but not to the population."

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the type of page we show to the users, we tested the effect of the country of a user on conversions. Our experiment resulted in 3 countries: UK, US and CA. I assume it stands for United Kingdom, USA and Canada. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the country of users to our regression model didn't have much effect on our ab_page variable(-0.0149 vs. previously -0.0150). According to  our experiment, whether the user comes from the US, UK and CA shows only little differences in conversions. We received a ranking of US, CA, UK with US users being the most likely to convert. If the user was from the USA, they were 1.01 times more likely to convert than if they were from Canada holding all other variables constant. If the user was from Canada, they were 1.04 times more likely to convert than if they were from the UK holding all other variables constant. However, the p-values of our coefficients are all greater than alpha/2=0.025. Hence, we fail to reject that there is no effect of whether the user is from the US, UK or CA on conversions. \n",

    "Once you are satisfied with the status of your Notebook, you should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit both your original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission. If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

    "When you're ready, click on the \"Submit Project\" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
